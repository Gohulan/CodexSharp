# CodexSharp

CodexSharp is a C# wrapper for OpenAI's Codex API and GPT-3 language model. With this package, you can easily generate natural language text and code completions using the power of AI.

=========================
Installation
=========================
You can install CodexSharp via NuGet:
dotnet add package CodexSharp

=========================
Usage
=========================
To use CodexSharp, you'll need to obtain an API key from OpenAI. Once you have an API key, you can create an instance of the GPT class and use its GenerateText method to generate text. Here's an example:


using CodexSharp;

var apiKey = "your_api_key_here";
var gpt = new GPT(apiKey);

var prompt = "Once upon a time";
var text = await gpt.GenerateText(prompt);

Console.WriteLine(text);

This code will generate natural language text using OpenAI's GPT-3 model based on the provided prompt.

You can also use CodexSharp to generate code completions and suggestions using the Codex class. Here's an example:

using CodexSharp;

var apiKey = "your_api_key_here";
var codex = new Codex(apiKey);

var prompt = "public static void main";
var completions = await codex.Complete(prompt);

foreach (var completion in completions)
{
    Console.WriteLine(completion.Text);
}
This code will generate code completions and suggestions using OpenAI's Codex API based on the provided prompt.

For more information on the available options and parameters for text and code generation, please refer to the OpenAI API documentation.
